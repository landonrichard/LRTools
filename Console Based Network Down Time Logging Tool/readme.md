Console Based Network Down Time Logging Tool

## Description

This is a tool I made that will attempt to ping a server every 1 second and then write the percenent of up and downtime to a text file.
You can easily change the ping destination by editing the file.

This tool is written in batch and doesn't use any dependencies.
